Some potential problems when coding this game:

- **Collision detection accuracy:** Using `getBoundingClientRect()` for collision between the player and falling objects can be imprecise, especially if the player or objects are resized or animated.
- **Performance on mobile:** Frequent DOM updates and many falling objects can cause lag on low-end devices or browsers.
- **Responsive layout issues:** Ensuring all elements (controls, game area, feedback) remain usable and visible on all screen sizes can be tricky.
- **Input conflicts:** Touch, mouse, and keyboard events may interfere with each other, especially if buttons take focus or if multiple inputs are used simultaneously.
- **Timer and interval management:** If the game is reset quickly or multiple times, old intervals or timeouts may still run, causing unexpected behavior.
- **Accessibility:** Ensuring the game is usable with screen readers, keyboard-only navigation, and that color contrast is sufficient.
- **Resource loading:** If the charity: water logo image fails to load, the branding may be lost or the layout may break.
- **Cheating or unintended interactions:** Users may exploit double-click or click events to manipulate score or reset the game in unintended ways.
- **Browser compatibility:** Some CSS or JS features (like emoji rendering, pointer events, or backdrop-filter) may not work the same in all browsers.

Testing on multiple devices and browsers, and handling edge cases in code, can help mitigate these issues.
